## Usage

Typical usage involves running the main script to fetch alerts and process them:

```

You can schedule this to run periodically (e.g., with `cron` on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows) for automated monitoring.

If the project supports CLI options, use `--help` to see available commands:

```bash
python main.py --help
```
